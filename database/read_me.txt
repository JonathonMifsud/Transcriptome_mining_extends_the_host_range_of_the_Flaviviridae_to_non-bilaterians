This fasta file was used to create a DIAMOND Blast database. Searches were conducted using the following parameters:
'diamond blastx -e 1E-4 -c2 -k 3 --ultra-sensitive'

This database was simply created through searches of the NCBI nucleotide and protein databases.
The database is not an exhaustive collection of Flaviviridae sequences, but rather a "slightly" curated selection of sequences from various clades.As such, this database is useful for the rapid search of flavi-like sequences using highly sensitive similarity searches but would not be useful for other purposes.
